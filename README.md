# Mixify

Mixify is a free full-stack web application that aims to expand a user's Spotify discography by generating a unique playlist tailored to the user's personality, mood, and desires. After users take a Buzzfeed-style quiz, we use Spotify's web API to match the user's preferences with song properties such as danceability, tempo, loudness, etc.
