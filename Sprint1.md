**What issues did your team plan to address?**
For Sprint 1, we intended to address issues 1, 2, and 3, and we wanted to start working on issue 4.

**Which ones were successfully completed?**
We successfully completed the first three issues.

**Which ones didn't and why?**
We didn't get very far into issue 4 because we realized that we need to better familiarize ourselves with the Spotify API in order to generate the proper questions to ask in our survey. More specifically, we need to have a better understanding of what type of music metrics Spotify uses when analyzing music, so that we can find questions that will relate.
